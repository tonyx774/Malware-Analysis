# RisePro Malware Analysis
SHA-256: **174b0542f7ec81deaa7cee471a9194512e04a67b5294f651d9cdf6035648d23a**
File Type: 32-bit Windows Executable

## Description:
RisePro is a malware sample that functions as both an info-stealer and a dropper for additional payloads.

## Unpacking
RisePro uses a packer not identified by tools like unpack.me or Detect It Easy, prompting manual unpacking via a debugger. 
The sample appears to be packed with Themida, which employs numerous anti-debugging techniques. 
After bypassing these checks, shellcode was written to memory address 00411000, which was then dumped and analyzed using Binary Ninja. Since Themida is a commercial packer used in legitimate applications, this unpacking method will not be described in detail in this report.


## C2 Communication Function
The main C2 communication function contained references to DLLs that were not attached to the dumped shellcode.
By statically comparing the memory addresses of these functions to the import address table of the running process, functions such as the WinAPI Sleep function were identified and renamed in the dumped shellcode.

The primary purpose of this function is to connect to a C2 server at 127[.]45[.]47[.]126 on port 58709. By redirecting this IP address to 127.0.0.1, C2 requests were rerouted to a local machine. 
A Python socket server was then set up to interact with the malware, allowing observation of its behavior in response to different dynamic conditions.

The binary attempts to connect to the C2 server continously with a sleep call of 1 millisecond followed by a sleep call of 100 milliseconds between each connection attempt.

## C2 Encryption/Decryption Function
Upon calling the recv function to receive data from the socket, the first 8 bytes are checked to match the hex string ADDABAAB, serving as a validation check. The subsequent decryption function uses a substitution table and XOR to decrypt the received data.

## Check Command Function
Once data is decrypted, the checkCommand function is invoked to verify the command sent in the response data. This sample included additional commands, such as 0x2731, which were not fully analyzed at this time as they were not utilized.
